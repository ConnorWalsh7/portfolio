# Summary
Let's Schedule automates the process of finding group availability by automatically looking through each group members existing calendars to highlight ideal meeting times everyone has in common.
This eliminates the need for back and forth "when is everyone free?" discussion and does not require any users to manually input availability. 

Let's Schedule is under active development and much of the interface is "function over form" while being developed and subject to change to improve user experience later on.

Let's Schedule is currently compatible with Google Calendar and any Microsoft based calendar (Outlook, Exchange, Office365, etc).
