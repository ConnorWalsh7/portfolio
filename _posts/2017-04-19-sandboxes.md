Nova Scotia Sandboxes are a provincial wide program to host collaborative workspaces at Nova Scotian universities and NSCC. Sandboxes act as a hub where students, mentors, and advisors can all work together to take innovative new ideas and bring them to market. Sandboxes also host various events such as workshops, programming competitions, interactive demonstrations, and more  

The current problem is each Sandbox is run independently with no unified platform for posting events and news. Each Sandbox uses their own method of distribution such as school websites, email lists, flyers, or word of mouth. The goal of our Sandbox Activity Manager project is to create one platform for all Sandbox managers to use to post news articles, create events, handle event registration, track attendance, and generate automated reports.  

In addition to the unified administrative web interface, we developed an iOS and Android app for students to also have one unified platform for reading all Sandbox news, browsing and registering for events, and keeping up to date with Sandboxes other than their own.The administrative web interface was created with Laravel, an MVC framework for building web applications in PHP.  

A web API was also developed along side the administrative backend which is used to automatically upload news and events to our mobile applications. The mobile applications were developed with Ionic, a framework for building hybrid mobile apps with AngularJS.  

Our project was built with flexibility and collaboration in mind. We give Sandbox managers the ability to host joint events between multiple sandboxes, post news articles to users from any Sandbox, and provide a provincial wide audience to all Sandboxes to truly bring Nova Scotia's brightest together
