# Summary
Term project for CSCI 4176 Mobile Computing class. Working with a team of four other students we created KRUSH, a native Android app that connects students with tutors. 
KRUSH was developed as a prototype over a two month period during the Mobile Computing class 

# Problem
Students looking for tutors is an old problem that dates as far back to when schools first started. 
Despite this age old problem, the methods for connecting student and tutors remain ancient.
Even in today's day and age the current most reliable system for finding tutors is flyers on telephone poles and bulletin boards or word of mouth.

How do you find someone who is tutoring for your specific University class? How do you know if this person is actually knowledgeable? How do you pay for their services safely and securely?

# Solution

#### KRUSH - a modern solution to connect students and tutors. 

### Profiles
KRUSH allows tutors to setup profiles and set their own schedules, subjects, prices, and preferred tutoring locations.
Students can also setup profiles and browse a list of available tutors and filter by school and classes.
Students can view a tutors profile, see their rating left by other students, and book a tutoring session.

### Booking
A student will view a tutors subjects and scheduling availability and have the option to book a tutoring session during one of the tutors available times
The tutoring session will be saved under the students and tutors upcoming sessions list. The details of the session will be displayed as well as an option to cancel the session
